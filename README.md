# Design Patterns with Java
I'm studying design patterns. I will be creating examples and 
adding notes about each one to this repository as I go. I hope you
find this helpful!

### Strategy Pattern
> The strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets
the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

### Observer Pattern
> The observer section is still under construction.
