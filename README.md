# Design Patterns with Java
I'm studying design patterns. I will be creating examples and 
adding notes about each one to this repository as I go. I hope you
find this helpful!

### Design Principles
> <ol>
>   <li>Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.</li>
>   <li>Program to an interface, not an implementation.</li>
>   <li>Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.</li>
> </ol>

### Strategy Pattern
> The strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets
the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
- [Strategy Example](src/main/java/com/welcometodannyland/strategy)
- [Strategy Notes](src/main/java/com/welcometodannyland/strategy/strategyNotes.md)

### Observer Pattern
> The observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all the 
dependents are notified and updated automatically.
